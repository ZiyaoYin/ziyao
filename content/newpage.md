        UR5e Robot arm and Me

        Important tasks involved in this project include:

        - Design End Effector Rim and housing in SolidWorks
        - Programming arduino system with LCD screen and sensor
        - Motion planning of the UR5e Arm in Python ROS, MoveIt and Gazebo

        All thanks to Duke MEMS department, We have the Universal UR5e with gripper/end effector Robotiq 2F-140 to play with.

        To illustrate our knowledge of robot control and hardware design we learned this semester, our team has engineered an arcade game featuring an UR5e robotic arm. With UR5e robotic arm as its centerpiece, we integrate a designed 3D rim and an arduino system with an LCD screen and a sensor. The robot arm would dynamically move and present a challenge for players who aim to shoot ping-pong balls into a designated rim. Scores are displayed on an LCD screen, which is managed through an Arduino board connected to a sensor system.

        Final Design

        **Arduino Logistics**

        My work primarily involves implementing an Arduino system with our robotic arm alongside [Athre Hollakal](https://sites.google.com/view/athre-hollakal/about-me). We have successfully designed and implemented a system where the difficulty of the sensor changes every 20 seconds...

        **Motion Planning and Testing**

        Motion planning for moving the robotic arm was initially done in simulation using **Gazebo** and **Planit**...
